Although he would rather obtain these shards alone, Inuyasha reluctantly travels with companions who can assist him, such as Kagome and Shippo who prove more than capable of providing assistance when he needs it. From acquiring one of his father's swords, Tetsusaiga, the sword of destruction becomes the prevailing alternative to his lethal claws. Though his claw's signature "Iron Reverse Soul Stealer" is no move to scoff at, he's at his most powerful in battle when wielding the massive sword of destruction Tetsusaiga.

pupil and began to train him up, though more often than not, his student was
left to clean up after him and pay off his debts.
