Sakaki The strong, silent type of the group, Sakaki often gives off an aura of being particularly cool - something that her tall stature and althletic prowess doesn't help. While she appears to be somewhat untouchable and out of most people's league, the quiet high school girl is actually very kind, and easy to approach. She has a heart of gold and a love of all things cute, especially when it comes to cats - though they never seem to reciprocate her feelings and instead have a nasty habit of biting her instead.

At school, she's a polite honor student admired for her good looks, excellent grades, and talent at sports. At home she drops the facade and puts on her orange hamster hoodie, becoming a messy, lazy, junk food-loving couch potato whose world revolves around video games and anime. She also has a third persona, master video gamer UMR, where she puts up her hair and dons a hat and mask so that her classmates from school don't recognize their "idol" bumming around the video arcade. To keep her friends from learning about her other identities Umaru goes to extreme and often bizarre lengths to keep them in the dark, like posing as her own little sister (who doesn't exist) and befriending people multiple times as two different people.

Matsu Matsu is Sekirei #02 of 108. An intelligence-type sekirei, she can hack into any electronic device whether it be cellphone or military satellite. She uses her subsequently augmented surveillance capacity to perv on Minato at every opportunity, but relishes the chance to get some hands on 'experimentation' time. Though she has been known to do a field op or two, she spends most of her time hiding from MBI agents in the Izumo Inn.

Makina The comically well-endowed warden of Deadman Wonderland takes her job of maintaining order in the prison seriously almost to a fault. She has little patience for prisoners who step out of line and can't stand the frivilous machinations of the Promoter when they interfere with her charge.

Karin MAAKA Karin is a vampire – albeit a peculiar one. She can walk in sunlight, can’t stand the taste of blood, and lacks the senses and powers of her fanged brethren. But more importantly, a rare abnormality causes her body to build up too much blood, requiring her to inject the excess into a victim lest she have an explosive nosebleed and pass out. Her 'problem' aside Karin is kind, social, easily-embarrassed and very well-endowed – a fact that has a tendency to leave others jealous of her figure. Given her family sleeps during the day, Karin takes care of herself, cooks and keeps up a part-time job to take care of the household expenses.
Karin has a bizarre but strong relationship with Kenta Usui, who attends school with her.
